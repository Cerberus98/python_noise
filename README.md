Noise Generators
================

## Perlin noise
Built using this as reference: http://devmag.org.za/2009/04/25/perlin-noise/

Useful for generating noise that looks somewhat like terrain, especially for making height maps. Popular lately with voxel engines (Minecraft) especially.

To run it, you'll need to have pygame installed, and then simply call the script

```
python perlin.py
```

### Keys:
* Space generates a new noise sample
* Left and Right arrows cycle through the various stages of noise (base, smoothed variations, final blended)
* ESC quits
